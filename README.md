# Weight_HypothesisTest

This small project will use a dataset on obesity from another project that aimed to predict BMI. The goal is to create a confidence interval for the likely range of the true population mean for weight. This will be followed by a hypothesis test against the sample mean to determine the likelihood that it differs from the true population mean. The population from which this sample was drawn is unknown, but this project is just for practice purposes.

From the data source: "This dataset contains information about the obesity classification of individuals. The data was collected from a variety of sources, including medical records, surveys, and self-reported data."
